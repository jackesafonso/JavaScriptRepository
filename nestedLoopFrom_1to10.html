<p>In this example, we have two loops. Because there is one loop that is inside the other, we call this a nested loop. The first loop is often called an "outer loop", and the second is often called the "inner loop" because it is inside the first, outer loop.</p>

<p>The outer loop executes first, and for each time the outer loop is executed, the inner loop will also execute.</p>
    
  <!--    <button onclick="myFunction()">Try it</button>-->

<!--
<button onclick="myFunction()">Try it</button>

(onclick) was replaced by <button type="button" id="button1">Try it</button because that's the old wasys of doing it, the more recent way to do it is through EventListener:

e.g.

var event1 = document.getElementById("button1");
event1.addEventListener('click' , myFunction , false);
    
-->

<button type="button" id="button1">Try me</button>

<p id="demo"></p>

<script>
var event1 = document.getElementById("button1");
event1.addEventListener('click', myFunction, false);
    
function myFunction() {
    var text = "";
    var i, j;

    for (i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        text += "<br>" + "i = " + i + ", j = ";

        for (j = 0; j < 10; j++) {
            document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = text += j + " ";
        }
    }
}
</script>
